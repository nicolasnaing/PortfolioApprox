# PortfolioApprox
1.	the question for my project was “given data for 3 assets, how can we find the allotment for each asset that maximizes return”
2.	can capture the nature of the 3 assets through 1x3 mean vector mu and 3x3 matrix sigma for the covariances of the 3 assets

12.	tried seeing if the lost return was smaller when multiplying off diagonal sigma terms by some constant
ties to statistical method of shrinking (using a grand average to capture small variables that can change data)

List of file names:
portfolioapprox is tex files
portfolioapprox1 is code for first question
portfolioapprox2 is code for first part of second question (only tested .5 .6 .7 .8 .9)
unifgroupresults is code for second part of second question, first set of rvs with 0.00 to 1.00 coefficients
correlated is code for third part of second question, second set of rvs (uncorrelated)


results1 contains results for first question 
results2 is for first + second part of second question
results3 are for third part of second question
